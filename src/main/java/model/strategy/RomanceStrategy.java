 * RomanceStrategy implements AIStrategy and provides a warm, emotional,

 * Person C (AI Integration):
 *  - Will replace all PLACEHOLDER TEXT with OpenAI-generated romantic prose.
 *  - Will build prompts using Character traits, World atmosphere, and chapter progression.
 *
 * The Strategy defines *meaning* behind choices:
 *  - Choice "A" typically represents vulnerability, openness, emotional risk.
 *  - Choice "B" typically represents cautious distance, emotional protection.
